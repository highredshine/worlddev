            this project aims to understand what it means to be a developed or developing country,
            or what we can do for developing ones to become developed.

            Using each indicator as a feature of a country, 
            we can represent a country as a vector of an n-dimensional space (n as in the number of indicators).
            We can then perform principal component analysis to create a visually intuitive clusters of countries.

            into developed and developing countries.
