            This project was inspired from the quote above. 
            The human civilization has developed for about 6000 years now, and 
            the current world now is divided into so-called 'developed' and 'developing' countries.
            Using World Bank's latest data on 'World Development Indicators', 
            this project aims to understand what it means to be a developed or developing country,
            or what we can do for developing ones to become developed.

            gathered from all around the world. The default plot shows the world average of some of the
            representative indicators such as electricity access. There are several ways to oberse the data.
            ###### - choose one country and pick one or more indicators to understand the development of the country.
            ###### - choose one indicator and pick one or more countries to understand the relevance of the indicator.

            ### Analyzing the Indicators
            Using each indicator as a feature of a country, 
            we can represent a country as a vector of an n-dimensional space (n as in the number of indicators).
            Using these vectors, we can cluster the country vectors, and analyze whether they form groups similar
            to how they are categorized into developed and developing countries. We can visualize these clusters
            with either the average values of the indicators, or by each year. This way, we can see if the
            clusters (development status) change as time passed.
